## 1. COLOR PALETTE (Hex Codes)

We use a "Medical + Vitality" palette. It avoids the cold "hospital white" look by adding warm accents.

| **SECONDARY** | **Therapeutic Green** | `#4A9B7F` | Subtitles, Icons, Safety. Represents health & balance.     |
| **ACCENT**    | **Vitality Coral**    | `#E17055` | CTAs (Buttons), Highlights, "Pain Relief" points. Energy.  |
| **NEUTRAL**   | **Soft Cream**        | `#FFF8F0` | Warm backgrounds (instead of stark white).                 |

## 4. IMAGE GENERATION RULES (For DALL-E/Midjourney)

When generating images, ALWAYS include these keywords to maintain consistency:

> "Professional medical photography, bright natural lighting, modern minimalist clinic aesthetic, teal and deep blue color palette, high resolution, soft bokeh background."

**Negative Prompts (What to avoid):**

> "Cartoon, illustration, 3D render, dark shadows, text inside image, distorted hands, messy medical equipment, cluttered background."
