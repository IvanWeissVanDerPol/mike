## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Who Mike Actually Is**: Mikie Moyano Nakamura, physiotherapy STUDENT (not licensed professional)  
**Capital Available**: Gs. 0 (hoping for Gs. 5M bank loan - NOT approved)  
**Legal Status**: CANNOT practice independently - no degree, no matrícula profesional

## PART 1: CLIENT IDENTITY & STATUS

### **Personal Information**

| Field | Response | Verification | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Mikie Moyano Nakamura | ✅ Per questionnaire | Different from "Mike González" used in plan |
| **Profession** | Kinesiologist/Physiotherapist | ⚠️ STUDENT | Not licensed professional |
| **University Degree** | None (still student) | ✅ Confirmed | BLOCKING for independent practice |
| **MSPBS License** | None | ✅ Confirmed | BLOCKING for legal operation |
| **AKYFPY Registration** | None mentioned | ❌ Not verified | Typically requires degree first |
| **Professional Experience** | Blank (none specified) | ✅ Confirmed | Zero practical experience |

**CRITICAL MISMATCH**:
- Business plan assumed: Licensed professional ready to practice
- Reality: Student without legal right to operate consultorio

---

## PART 2: FINANCIAL REALITY

### **Capital Situation**

| Source | Amount (Gs.) | Status | Verification |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **Personal Savings** | 0 | ✅ Verified | Zero capital available |
| **Family Loan** | 0 | ✅ Verified | No family financial support |
| **Bank Loan** | 5,000,000 | ⚠️ INTENDED (not approved) | Hope, not commitment |
| **Total Available** | **0** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Listed as Gs. 0 on questionnaire |

**Analysis**:
- Mike listed "Gs. 5,000,000" for bank loan
- BUT marked "Total Capital Available: Gs. 0"
- **Interpretation**: He HOPES for Gs. 5M loan but doesn't have approval
- **Bank loan approval probability**: 5-10% (unlicensed student, zero income, zero collateral)

### **Capital Requirements vs. Reality**

| Scenario | Investment Needed | Mike Has | Gap | Executable? |
|----------|------------------|----------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Domicilio Puro | Gs. 4,750,000 | Gs. 0-5M | -95% to 0% | ❌ NO |
| 2. Mixto San Lorenzo | Gs. 38,500,000 | Gs. 0-5M | -87% to -100% | ❌ NO |
| 3. Consultorio Mínimo | Gs. 35,000,000 | Gs. 0-5M | -86% to -100% | ❌ NO |
| 4. Mixto Asunción | Gs. 55,399,850 | Gs. 0-5M | -91% to -100% | ❌ NO |
| 5. Premium | Gs. 75,000,000 | Gs. 0-5M | -93% to -100% | ❌ NO |

**Verdict**: Undercapitalized by 86-100% for ALL scenarios.

### **Income Requirements**

| Need | Response | Implication |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **When income needed?** | Month 1 | Zero tolerance for ramp-up period |
| **Parallel income?** | None (can work full-time) | No income buffer |
| **Savings buffer?** | None (Gs. 0) | Cannot survive unprofitable months |

**Monthly Survival Need (estimated)**:
```
Personal living expenses: Gs. 1,500,000 - 2,000,000
Bank loan payment (if approved): Gs. 300,000 - 400,000
Business costs (Scenario 1): Gs. 580,000
Transportation (Uber): Gs. 400,000

MINIMUM REQUIRED: Gs. 2,780,000 - 3,380,000/month from DAY 1
```

**Reality**: Even best-case Scenario 1 generates Gs. 1.0-1.8M net in Month 1.  
**Shortfall**: Gs. 1.0-2.4M/month = UNSUSTAINABLE

---

## PART 3: LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (PARAGUAY)

### **What Law Requires to Practice Physiotherapy**

| Requirement | Status | Source | Mike Has? |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Título Universitario** (University degree) | MANDATORY | MSPBS | ❌ NO (still student) |
| **Matrícula Profesional** (MSPBS registration) | MANDATORY | MSPBS Res. 307/22 | ❌ NO |
| **AKYFPY Registration** | Recommended | AKYFPY guidelines | ❌ NO |
| **Habilitación Local** (space licensing) | Required for consultorio | Municipal | ❌ NO |
| **RUC** (tax registration) | Required | DNIT | ❌ Unknown |

**Legal Verdict**: ❌ **CANNOT OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY**

### **What Students CAN Do Legally**

| Activity | Legal? | Requirements | Generates Income? |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Independent consultorio** | ❌ NO | Requires full licensure | N/A |
| **Work as assistant (practicante)** | ✅ YES | Under licensed PT supervision | ✅ Gs. 2-3M/month |
| **Hospital/clinic employee** | ✅ YES | As unlicensed assistant | ✅ Gs. 1.5-2.5M/month |
| **Personal training** | ✅ YES | Different profession (no PT claims) | ✅ Variable |
| **Sports massage** | ⚠️ GRAY | Cannot call it "fisioterapia" | ✅ Variable |
| **Home visits (as PT)** | ❌ NO | Requires matrícula profesional | N/A |

**Legal Source**: `referencias/marco-legal.md` lines 136-169

**Consequence of Illegal Practice**:
- Criminal offense in Paraguay
- Fines + potential jail time
- Permanent career damage
- Cannot obtain license later if convicted

## PART 4: BUSINESS MODEL PREFERENCES

### **Modality Preference**

| Option | Response | Analysis |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **MIXTO** (Clinic + Home) | ✓ Checked | Requires Gs. 55M capital + license |
| **DOMICILIO PURO** (Home only) | ✓ Checked | Only affordable option, still requires license |
| **CONSULTORIO FIJO** (Clinic only) | ✗ Not checked | Would require Gs. 35-75M |

**Contradiction**: Checked BOTH Mixto and Domicilio—unclear which is priority.

**Reality**: Neither is legally possible without license.

### **Venue Preference**

| Aspect | Response | Viability |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Clinic type** | Shared consultorio (not private) | ✅ Cost-effective choice |
| **Clinic size** | 25-35 m² (2 treatment areas) | ✅ Reasonable |
| **Location** | Villa Aurelia | ✅ Good choice (but unaffordable) |

### **Operational Details**

| Factor | Response | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Vehicle** | None (Uber/public transport) | 🔴 KILLS home visit economics |
| **Capacity** | 8-10 sessions/day | ✅ Reasonable estimate |
| **Availability** | Full-time | ✅ Can dedicate fully |

**Home Visit Economics BROKEN**:
```
Original plan (own vehicle):
- Revenue: Gs. 170K/session
- Variable cost: Gs. 23K (fuel)
- Margin: Gs. 147K (86%)

Mike's reality (Uber):
- Revenue: Gs. 150K (wants lower price)
- Uber round-trip: Gs. 60-80K
- Supplies: Gs. 23K
- Margin: Gs. 47-67K (31-45%)

MARGIN EROSION: -55% to -64%
Break-even jumps from 15 to 25-32 sessions/month
```

## PART 5: MARKET POSITIONING

### **Target Audience**

| Segment | Interest Level | Plan Alignment |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Office workers (postural pain) | ✓ Interested | ✅ Matches plan |
| Athletes (sports injuries) | ✓ Interested | ✅ Matches plan |
| Elderly (geriatrics) | ✓ Interested | ✅ Matches plan |

**Analysis**: "All segments" = no clear focus = harder to market.

### **Pricing Strategy**

| Question | Response | Analysis |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Accept recommended Gs. 150K?** | ❌ NO | Rejected recommendation |
| **Reason** | "Still student, not titled professional" | 🔴 STRATEGIC ERROR |
| **Wants** | LOWER prices | 🔴 Competing on price from weakness |

**Recommended price**: Gs. 150,000 (already 12% below AKYFPY Gs. 170K)  
**Mike wants**: LOWER than Gs. 150K (possibly Gs. 120-130K)

**Why This is Dangerous**:
- Lower price = harder to hit income targets
- "Student pricing" signals lack of credentials
- Attracts price-sensitive clients (high churn)
- Cannibalizes future pricing power post-license
- Creates precedent that's hard to raise later

**Correct Strategy**: Match or slightly beat market (Gs. 145-155K), compete on service quality, NOT price.

### **Services Offered**

| Service Type | Interest | Viable? |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Traumatology/Orthopedics | ✓ | ⚠️ Requires license |
| Sports physiotherapy | ✓ | ⚠️ Requires license |
| Postural pain | ✓ | ⚠️ Requires license |
| Kinesiotaping | ✓ | ⚠️ Requires license |
| Electrotherapy | ✓ | ⚠️ Requires license + equipment |
| Geriatrics | ✓ | ⚠️ Requires license |

**Specialization**: None - wants to be "generalist in Year 1"  
**Analysis**: ✅ Smart for beginner, but all require license anyway.

## PART 6: NETWORK & MARKETING

### **Current Network Status**

| Asset | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Gym contacts** | ZERO | No referral channel |
| **Medical referrals** | ZERO | No prescription pipeline |
| **Corporate contacts** | ZERO | No B2B revenue |
| **Social media presence** | NONE | No brand awareness |
| **Existing patient base** | ZERO | 100% cold start |
| **Professional reputation** | ZERO | Unknown in market |

**Implication**: 100% of clients must come from:
- Paid advertising (high CAC)
- Cold outreach (low conversion)
- Walk-ins (unlikely with no presence)

**Marketing Budget**: Gs. 500K (from Scenario 1)  
**Realistic CAC**: Gs. 150-200K/client  
**Clients affordable**: 2-3 clients total

**This is Not Viable** for 15-25 sessions/month target.

### **Competitive Intelligence**

| Research | Status | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Mystery shopping** | ❌ NOT DONE | No pricing data |
| **Competitor analysis** | ❌ NOT DONE | Flying blind |
| **Market validation** | ❌ NOT DONE | Untested assumptions |

**Why This Matters**:
- Don't know if Gs. 150K is competitive or leaving money on table
- Don't know competitor service levels
- Don't know what "student pricing" should be
- Can't differentiate without knowing competition

---

## PART 7: TIMELINE & EXPECTATIONS

### **Launch Timeline**

| Milestone | Mike's Want | Reality | Gap |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Target launch** | 15-20 days (March 2) | 6-12 months minimum | -95% |
| **"Day 1"** | March 2, 2026 | Post-graduation + licensure | 6-12 month delay |

**What Must Happen Before Legal Launch**:
```
☐ Graduate from university (6-12 months?)
☐ Receive título universitario (graduation day)
☐ Submit MSPBS registration (30-60 day process)
☐ Receive matrícula profesional (bureaucratic delay)
☐ Obtain bank loan approval (2-4 weeks IF approved)
☐ Purchase equipment (1 week)
☐ Complete legal setup (RUC, RESIMPLE) (1 week)
☐ Find space (if consultorio) (2-4 weeks)

MINIMUM TIMELINE: 6-12 months
```

**Possible Interpretation**: Mike wants to "start working" in 15-20 days, which IS achievable as an assistant.

### **Setup Availability**

| Question | Response | Analysis |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Available for setup tasks?** | "Variable (depends on day)" | ⚠️ Not full availability |
| **Current employment?** | None | ✅ Can work full-time |

---

## PART 8: STRATEGIC & PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS

### **Competitive Advantage**

**Mike's Response**: "My way of relating to patients and active listening"

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Soft skills are genuine differentiator
- ✅ Cannot be easily copied
- ⚠️ Hard to communicate in marketing ("everyone says this")
- ⚠️ Only works AFTER getting first clients (chicken-egg problem)

**Challenge**: How to demonstrate "active listening" in a flyer/ad?

### **Biggest Fear**

**Mike's Response**: "Lack of clientele due to social stigmas"

**Analysis**:
- ⚠️ Vague - which stigmas? (Physiotherapy stigma? Student stigma? Price stigma?)
- 🔴 **Possible interpretation**: Fear clients won't come because he's unlicensed
- This fear is VALID—operating without license creates legal AND market stigma

**Deeper Issue**: If his fear is stigma about being unlicensed, it reveals he KNOWS this is a problem but wants to proceed anyway.

## PART 9: CRITICAL GAPS & UNKNOWNS

### **Information NOT Provided**

| Missing Info | Why It Matters | Impact |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Graduation date** | Determines earliest possible legal launch | BLOCKING timeline |
| **University name** | Affects degree credibility | Minor |
| **Current semester/year** | How far from graduation? | Timeline planning |
| **Why needs income Month 1** | Family obligation? Debt? | Risk tolerance |
| **Backup plan if loan rejected** | Financial safety net | Critical |
| **Has he researched legal requirements?** | Awareness of license issue | Ethical concern |

### **Assumptions to Verify**

| Assumption | Source | Verification Needed |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Mike knows he can't practice unlicensed | None | ❌ ASK DIRECTLY |
| Bank loan is realistic | His hope | ❌ Pre-qualify check |
| He can graduate in 6-12 months | Implied | ❌ Confirm timeline |
| He's willing to work as assistant | None | ❌ Gauge openness |
| "Student pricing" means Gs. 120-130K | Interpretation | ❌ Clarify amount |

---

## PART 10: BUSINESS PLAN ALIGNMENT

### **What Was Assumed in Business Plan**

| Aspect | Business Plan Assumed | Mike's Reality | Aligned? |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Professional status** | Licensed PT | Unlicensed student | ❌ NO |

| **Vehicle** | Owns car | No vehicle | ❌ NO |
| **Pricing** | Gs. 150K competitive | Wants even lower | ❌ NO |
| **Timeline** | Launch when ready | Must launch in 20 days | ❌ NO |
| **Location** | Villa Aurelia | Villa Aurelia | ✅ YES (only match) |

**Alignment Score**: 1/8 (12.5%)

### **Scenario Viability**

| Scenario | Legally Possible? | Financially Possible? | Overall Viability |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **1. Domicilio Puro** | ❌ NO (no license) | ⚠️ Maybe (if loan approved) | ❌ 0% |
| **2. Mixto San Lorenzo** | ❌ NO (no license) | ❌ NO (-87% capital) | ❌ 0% |
| **3. Consultorio Mínimo** | ❌ NO (no license) | ❌ NO (-86% capital) | ❌ 0% |
| **4. Mixto Asunción** | ❌ NO (no license) | ❌ NO (-91% capital) | ❌ 0% |
| **5. Premium** | ❌ NO (no license) | ❌ NO (-93% capital) | ❌ 0% |

**Verdict**: **ZERO scenarios executable** without addressing legal blocker.

## PART 11: VIABLE ALTERNATIVES

### **What Mike CAN Do Legally RIGHT NOW**

| Option | Legal? | Capital Needed | Income Potential | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Work as assistant under licensed PT** | ✅ YES | Gs. 0 | Gs. 2-3M/month | 15-20 days ✅ |

## PART 14: RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Immediate Actions (Next 72 Hours)**

1. **Deliver honest assessment** to Mike:
   - Cannot practice without license (legal reality)
   - Capital insufficient for independent operation
   - Apprentice path is best option

2. **Create "Phase 0" plan**:
   - Apprentice model implementation guide
   - Timeline: Now → Graduation → License → Launch
   - Repurpose existing business plan for "post-license"

3. **Research 10 consultorios** in Villa Aurelia/Asunción:
   - Identify licensed PTs who might hire assistant
   - Prepare approach script for Mike
   - Estimate realistic salary ranges

### **Strategic Messaging Framework**

**Tone**: Honest but constructive  
**Structure**:
1. Acknowledge his ambition (2 sentences)
2. Deliver hard truth about legal requirements (direct, no softening)
3. Validate his frustration
4. Pivot to viable alternative (apprentice path)
5. Reframe business plan as "launch kit for post-licensure"
6. Provide actionable 15-20 day plan (assistant job search)

**Key Message**:
> "You're not ready to launch a consultorio—but you ARE ready to start building toward one."

4. **What's your backup plan if the bank rejects the loan?** (Financial safety net)
5. **Why do you need income starting Month 1?** (Family obligation? Debt? Urgency level)
6. **Have you researched legal requirements to practice in Paraguay?** (Due diligence check)
