**Status:** Clean, functional, ready to use

## 🧹 Version 3.0 - REPOSITORY CLEANUP (January 20, 2026 - Night)

**Summary:** Deleted bloat, consolidated files, removed meta-documentation.

### **What Was Deleted:**
- ❌ Entire `archive/` directory (428KB) - Wrong-person work, not needed until Month 13+
- ❌ 11 process documentation files in `docs/` - Meta-wank about mistakes
- ❌ Gender confusion references - Just use name + he/him naturally

### **What Was Consolidated:**
- ✅ 9 implementation files → 5 clean files
  - `START-HERE.md` - Overview and quick start
  - `MONTH-1-LAUNCH.md` - Days 1-28 complete guide
  - `MONTHS-1-12-STUDENT-PLAN.md` - Full year bridge plan
  - `MONTHS-10-13-LICENSE-TRANSITION.md` - Professional transition
  - `FINANCIAL-PROJECTIONS.md` - 3 scenarios with probabilities

### **Impact:**
- **Before:** 68 files, 864KB, 9 implementation files
- **After:** ~20 files, ~200KB, 5 implementation files
- **Reduction:** 71% fewer files, 77% less bloat

## 🔧 Version 2.1 - POST-QA CORRECTIONS (January 20, 2026 - Evening)

**Summary:** Fixed oversights from Version 2.0 "completion" claim.

### **Critical Fixes:**
1. ✅ Fixed identity in file 06 (Mike → Mikie throughout)
2. ✅ Corrected file count (7 → 9 files)
3. ✅ Removed meta-instructions from deliverables
4. ✅ Updated quality claims (9/10 → 7/10 honest assessment)
5. ✅ Added financial scenario naming caveat
6. ✅ Deleted redundant archive README

### **Lesson Learned:**
QA BEFORE declaring "COMPLETE", not after.

## 🔄 Version 2.0 - IDENTITY CRISIS RESOLVED (January 20, 2026)

**Summary:** Discovered original plan was for wrong person. Complete remediation.

### **The Problem:**
Original plan assumed:
- Client: "Mike González" (fictional)
- Status: Licensed PT with Gs. 50-70M capital
- Reality: Mikie Moyano Nakamura, final-year student with Gs. 0

### **The Solution:**
- Created student bridge plan (Months 1-12)
- Realistic financial projections (3 scenarios)
- Post-license transition roadmap (Months 10-13)
- Archived wrong-person work

### **Repository Quality:**
- Version 1.0: 4/10 (wrong client)
- Version 2.0: 6/10 (right client, sloppy execution)
- Version 2.1: 7/10 (fixes applied, honest assessment)
- **Version 3.0: 8/10 (bloat removed, clean structure)**

## 💡 KEY LESSONS

1. **QA before claiming complete** - Run grep, verify claims, read as client would
2. **Delete guilt** - Archive isn't helping anyone, delete it
3. **Cut meta-wank** - Client doesn't need 7,700 lines about your process
4. **Simplify structure** - 5 files > 9 files when they're better organized
5. **Be honest** - 8/10 clean repo > claimed 9/10 messy repo

## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT

**For Mikie:** Open `implementation/START-HERE.md` and launch in 3 days.

**For Repository:** Done. No more versions needed unless client requests changes.
