## ✅ POST-SHOPPING CHECKLIST

Once you have everything:

- [ ] Wash all towels before first use (remove factory chemicals)
- [ ] Organize carrying bag:
  - Oils in sealed compartment (prevent leaks)
  - Clean towels in one section
  - Used towels separate bag (bring plastic bag for dirty towels)
  - Massage gun + charger
  - Hand sanitizer easily accessible
  - Pillows (if they fit, otherwise bring separately)
- [ ] Test everything: Does it all fit comfortably in the bag?

---

## 🔄 RESUPPLY SCHEDULE (After You Start)

**Weekly (After 4-6 sessions):**
- Wash all towels
- Check oil levels (refill when below 500ml)

**Monthly:**
- Buy more oil (1L per month if doing 16-20 sessions)
- Replace wipes/sanitizer as needed

**Every 3 Months:**
- Evaluate towel condition (replace if worn/stained)
- Upgrade equipment if income allows

---

## 💡 MONEY-SAVING TIPS

1. **Oils:** Start with coconut (cheaper), upgrade to almond later when income is steady
2. **Towels:** Buy 6 instead of 8 initially, add 2 more in Month 2
3. **Bag:** Reuse a backpack or gym bag you already have (save Gs. 30-80K)
4. **Wipes:** Buy alcohol (cheaper) + cotton pads instead of pre-made wipes
5. **Ask friends:** "Does anyone have extra towels I can borrow/buy cheap?"

---

## 🚨 DON'T BUY THESE YET (Wait Until Month 2-3)

❌ Massage table/mat (Gs. 200K-600K) - Friends' beds are fine for now  
❌ Essential oils for aromatherapy (Gs. 50K-100K) - Nice-to-have, not essential  
❌ Professional linens (Gs. 100K-150K) - Towels work fine  
❌ Bluetooth speaker (Gs. 80K-150K) - Use your phone  
❌ Fancy massage lotions (Gs. 50K+) - Basic oil works great  

**Why wait?** Validate demand first. After 10-15 sessions and Gs. 800K-1.2M income, THEN upgrade.

## ✅ READY TO SHOP?

1. Print this checklist (or save on phone)
