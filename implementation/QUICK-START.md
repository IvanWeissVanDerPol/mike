## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Say This EVERY Time

> "I'm a final-year PT student (graduate Jan 2027). This is wellness massage for practice, NOT medical treatment. If you have serious pain or injury, see a licensed professional. You understand I'm not licensed yet, right?"

**Wait for them to say "yes" before starting.**

## 🚨 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If client gets injured:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Call: 911 (ambulance)
3. Document what happened
4. Contact: [Your supervisor/mentor]

**If you feel unsafe:**
1. End session politely ("I have an emergency")
2. Leave immediately
3. Don't return

**If client doesn't pay:**
1. Ask politely once
2. If they refuse, let it go (don't fight)

## 💪 MINDSET

**You will face rejection.** Some friends will say no. That's normal.

**You will make mistakes.** First sessions will be awkward. That's normal.

**You will doubt yourself.** "Am I good enough?" That's normal.

**What matters:** Start. Get 1 paying client. Then another. Then another.

**Remember:** Every licensed PT started as a nervous student. You're no different.
