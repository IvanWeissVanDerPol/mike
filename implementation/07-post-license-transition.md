# 🎓 POST-LICENSE TRANSITION PLAN (Months 10-13)

> **For**: Mikie Moyano Nakamura  
> **Purpose**: Transition from student massage practice to licensed professional physiotherapist  
> **Timeline**: October 2026 → January 2027 (graduation + license)  
> **Critical**: This 4-month period determines your professional launch success

---

## 📊 OVERVIEW: The Critical Transition Window

**What's Happening:**
- **Month 10 (Oct 2026):** 3 months before graduation - Start license application
- **Month 11 (Nov 2026):** 2 months before - Prepare professional infrastructure
- **Month 12 (Dec 2026):** 1 month before - Final exams + license processing
- **Month 13 (Jan 2027):** LAUNCH - Graduate, receive license, go professional

**Why This Matters:**
- You cannot practice professionally without license (criminal offense)
- License processing takes 4-8 weeks after graduation
- Need professional equipment/space before launch
- Existing clients need smooth price transition (not shock)

**Expected Status by Month 10:**
- ✅ 200-250 massage sessions completed (7-9 months of practice)
- ✅ Gs. 10-15M saved (on track for professional launch)
- ✅ 30-50 active/past clients (your launch customer base)
- ✅ Proven demand for your services

---

## 📅 MONTH 10: LICENSE APPLICATION + EQUIPMENT (October 2026)

---

#### **Task 2: Prepare Business Registration (RUC Professional)**

  - IVA + IRE: Required if exceeding Gs. 80M/year
  - Professional services: 10% IVA typically
- [ ] Confirm you can keep RESIMPLE (likely yes, if projected revenue <Gs. 80M first year)
- [ ] Prepare documents for RUC update post-license

**Note:** Don't update RUC until you have professional license in hand.

---

#### **Task 3: Equipment Purchase Planning**

**Problem:** You've been using minimal equipment (massage gun, oils, towels)  
**Need:** Professional-grade equipment for licensed practice

**Priority 1 (MUST HAVE - Budget Gs. 8-12M):**

| Item | Why Critical | Budget | Where to Buy |
|------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| **Professional massage table** | Can't practice without it | Gs. 4-6M | MercadoLibre, Amazon (imported) |
| **Tens/EMS unit** | Standard physiotherapy tool | Gs. 1.5-2.5M | Casa Central Médica (Mcal. López) |
| **Ultrasound therapy** | Core modality for injuries | Gs. 2-3M | Casa Central Médica |
| **Exercise bands set** | Rehab exercises | Gs. 150-300K | Deportes Pinedo |
| **Professional linens** | Hygiene standards | Gs. 400-600K | Casa Nissei |

**Priority 2 (NICE TO HAVE - Budget Gs. 3-5M):**
- Laser therapy unit (Gs. 2-3M)
- Hot/cold therapy packs (Gs. 200-400K)
- Pilates ball + foam rollers (Gs. 150-300K)
- Professional uniforms (Gs. 300-500K)

**Priority 3 (FUTURE - Month 14+):**
- Shockwave therapy (Gs. 15-25M)
- Tecar therapy (Gs. 20-30M)

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Create detailed shopping list with exact models
- [ ] Research import costs if buying from abroad (table, ultrasound)
- [ ] Get quotes from 3 suppliers
- [ ] Budget: Allocate Gs. 10M from savings for equipment

**Timing:** Buy equipment in Month 11-12 (after confirming you'll graduate)

---

### **WEEK 2-4 (Oct 8-31): Price Transition Strategy**

#### **The Challenge:**

**Current pricing (student massage):**
- Tier 1 friends: Gs. 60-80K
- Tier 2 friends: Gs. 80-100K
- Average: Gs. 70-90K

**Future pricing (licensed PT):**
- Professional sessions: Gs. 170-200K
- Market rate for licensed physiotherapists

**The gap:** 2-3x price increase

**The risk:** Existing clients feel betrayed ("You're doubling prices on your friends?")

---

#### **Price Transition Strategy (3-Step Approach):**

**STEP 1: Pre-Announce (Month 10 - NOW)**

Send WhatsApp message to all active clients:

```
¡Hola [Name]! 🎉

Te quiero compartir una noticia emocionante: en enero me gradúo como 
fisioterapeuta licenciada! 

Esto significa que voy a poder ofrecer tratamientos profesionales completos 
(no solo masajes de relajación), pero también implica que los precios van 
a cambiar a tarifas de mercado (Gs. 170-200K por sesión).

Como agradecimiento por apoyarme durante mi práctica estudiantil, quiero 
ofrecerte una tarifa especial de "cliente fundador": Gs. 120K por sesión 
(40% descuento sobre precio profesional).

Esta tarifa especial es SOLO para quienes fueron mis clientes antes de 
recibirme. Disponible solo si reservas en enero-febrero 2027.

¿Te interesa? Puedo reservarte cupo ahora para enero.

¡Gracias por confiar en mí! 🙏
Mikie
```

**Why this works:**
- Advance notice (3 months warning)
- Explains WHY prices increase (licensed = different service level)
- Exclusive "founder" discount (makes them feel special)
- Creates urgency (only Jan-Feb, limited slots)
- Still profitable for you (Gs. 120K > Gs. 70-90K current)

---

**STEP 2: Final Student Sessions (Month 11-12)**

- Continue student pricing (Gs. 70-90K) until you graduate
- Remind clients every session: "This is my last month at student prices"
- Offer package deals: "Buy 4 sessions now at Gs. 280K, use them after I graduate"
- Goal: Pre-sell Gs. 2-3M worth of sessions (gives you launch runway)

---

**STEP 3: Professional Launch (Month 13)**

**Two-Tier Pricing:**

| Client Type | Price | Why |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| **Existing clients** (your 30-50 friends) | Gs. 120K | Loyalty discount, 40% off |
| **New clients** (referrals, marketing) | Gs. 170-200K | Market rate |

**Timeline:**
- Jan-Jun 2027: Honor Gs. 120K rate for existing clients
- Jul 2027+: Gradually raise to Gs. 150K for existing, keep Gs. 180-200K for new

**Expected outcome:**
- 60% of existing clients accept new pricing (18-30 clients)
- 40% churn (expected - some were only interested in cheap massage)
- Strong base to build from

---

### **Month 10 Checklist Summary:**

- [ ] Research MSPBS license requirements
- [ ] Start gathering license documents
- [ ] Create equipment shopping list (Gs. 10M budget)

### **WEEK 3-4 (Nov 15-30): Space Selection & Setup**

- Professional appearance (table, equipment visible)
- Privacy (no family interruptions)
- Parking nearby (if clients drive)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Gs. 0 rent
- ✅ Flexible hours
- ✅ Highest profit margin
- ✅ Can launch immediately

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited to 4-6 clients/day (space constraints)
- ❌ Less professional perception
- ❌ Zoning issues (some neighborhoods prohibit commercial activity)

**Setup cost:** Gs. 2-4M (equipment only)

---

**OPTION 2: Consultorio Compartido (Shared Clinic Space) - MEDIUM COST**

**What it is:** Rent desk/room in existing clinic or gym

**Typical arrangement:**
- Rent clinic space 3-4 days/week
- Pay per day (Gs. 150-250K/day) OR % of revenue (20-30%)
- Use their front desk, waiting room
- Bring your own equipment (usually)

**Where to find:**

- Sports medicine centers
- Wellness centers

**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional environment

**Cons:**

**Monthly cost:** Gs. 1.2-2M rent + Gs. 8-12M equipment

---

**OPTION 3: Solo Consultorio (Your Own Clinic) - HIGHEST COST**

**Save this for Month 18-24** after you have:
- ✅ Steady client base (30+ regulars)
- ✅ Gs. 40M+ saved
- ✅ Proven revenue (Gs. 10M+/month)

**Initial cost:** Gs. 35-50M (rent, equipment, buildout)

---

#### **Recommended Strategy for Month 13 Launch:**

**START with Option 1 (Home-Based) OR Option 2 (Shared Space)**

**Decision criteria:**

| If you have... | Choose... |
|----------------|-----------|
| Suitable room at home + Gs. 15M+ saved | **Home-based** (save rent, maximize profit) |
| No suitable home space OR want professional setting | **Shared clinic** (network, credibility) |
| Strong client demand (25+ prebooking) | **Shared clinic** (need capacity) |

**Action Items (Month 11):**
- [ ] If home-based: Prepare room (paint, organize, professional setup)
- [ ] If shared: Research 5-10 clinics/gyms, visit, negotiate terms
- [ ] Test setup with 1-2 clients (get feedback on space)

---

**Why:**
- ✅ Professional credibility

```

**Expected response:**

- [ ] Educational content (injury prevention, rehab tips)

**WhatsApp Business:**

---

#### **Step 3: Deliver First Professional Sessions**

**Difference from student massage:**

| Student Massage | Professional Physiotherapy |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 hour relaxation | 45-60 min treatment (assessment + therapy) |
| Massage only | Assessment + manual therapy + electrotherapy + exercises |
| Informal intake | Formal intake form, health history |
| Cash payment | Cash OR digital (Tigo Money, Giros Tigo) |
| No clinical notes | Document every session (legal requirement) |

**Session structure (professional):**
1. **Intake (5-10 min):** Health history, current complaint, goals
2. **Assessment (10-15 min):** Range of motion, strength, pain level
3. **Treatment (25-35 min):** Manual therapy, electrotherapy, stretching
4. **Exercise prescription (5-10 min):** Home exercises, next session plan
5. **Payment + booking:** Collect fee, schedule next visit

**Key difference:** You're treating injuries/dysfunction, not just relaxation

---

**4. Doctor referrals** (longer-term)
- Visit 5-10 general practitioners, orthopedists
- Leave business cards

## 🎯 POST-LAUNCH STRATEGY (Months 14-18)

**What happens after Month 13?**

### **Months 14-15: Stabilize & Optimize**

**Goals:**
- Retain 80% of existing clients (16-24 regulars)
- Add 10-15 new clients

- Income: Gs. 10-12M/month

**Focus areas:**
- Client retention (quality service, follow-ups)

- Gym partnerships (make them productive)

---

### **Months 16-18: Scale & Professionalize**

**Goals:**
- 40-50 regular clients
- 80-100 sessions/month (near capacity)
- Income: Gs. 12-15M/month
- Consider hiring assistant or expanding space

**Decisions at Month 18:**
- Do you need bigger space? (solo consultorio)
- Do you need help? (receptionist, assistant PT)
- Do you want to specialize? (sports rehab, geriatric, etc.)

---

### **Execute Archived Business Plan**

**Remember:** You have full business plan in `archive/original-plan-mike-gonzalez/`

**At Month 18, review:**
- `02-plan-negocio/01-estrategia-marketing.md` (full marketing playbook)
- `05-modelos-financieros/escenarios-financieros.md` (5 scenarios for growth)
- `02-plan-negocio/02-plan-operaciones.md` (systems, processes)

**Adapt for your situation:**
- Change "Mike González" to "Mikie Moyano"
- Adjust capital (you'll have Gs. 30-40M saved by then)
- Update pricing (based on market reality)
- Execute Scenario 1 (Solo Practice) or Scenario 2 (Shared) based on what worked

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### **Mistake #1: Practicing without license**
**Temptation:** "I have my degree, I can start treating people professionally now"  
**Reality:** LICENSE ≠ DEGREE. Must wait for MSPBS matriculation.  
**Risk:** Criminal charges, fines, career damage

### **Mistake #2: Shocking clients with 3x price increase**
**Bad:** "Hi, I'm licensed now. Gs. 180K from now on. See you Friday?"  
**Good:** Pre-announce in Month 10, offer founder pricing, gradual transition

### **Mistake #3: Spending all savings on equipment**
**Bad:** Buy Gs. 20M worth of equipment, launch with Gs. 0 runway  
**Good:** Keep Gs. 5-8M as emergency fund (3-4 months expenses)

### **Mistake #4: Quitting student massage too early**
**Bad:** "I graduated! No more cheap massage sessions!"  
**Reality:** License takes 4-8 weeks. Keep income flowing during wait.

### **Mistake #5: Not documenting sessions**
**Risk:** If client injury or complaint, you have no records (legal liability)  
**Fix:** Use templates from `04-plantillas/` (clinical notes, consent forms)

| Month | Massage Income | Expenses | Savings Added | Cumulative Savings |
|-------|----------------|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **10** | Gs. 1.8M | Gs. 200K | Gs. 1.6M | Gs. 11-13M |
| **11** | Gs. 1.8M | Gs. 500K | Gs. 1.3M | Gs. 12-14M |
| **12** | Gs. 1M | Gs. 10M (equipment) | -Gs. 9M | Gs. 3-5M |
| **13** | Gs. 7-10M | Gs. 2-3M | Gs. 5-7M | Gs. 8-12M |

**Key insight:** Month 12 is NEGATIVE cash flow (equipment purchase), but Month 13+ professional income makes up for it.

**Runway:** Keep Gs. 5M minimum as emergency fund (covers 2-3 months if slow start)
