## 💡 SUCCESS PRINCIPLES (READ BEFORE YOU START)

### **1. Legal Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- ✅ ALWAYS disclose you're a student (not licensed yet)
- ✅ NEVER call yourself "fisioterapeuta" publicly
- ✅ NEVER advertise on social media as "fisioterapia services"
- ✅ Stay under 28 sessions/month (looks like informal help, not a business)
- ✅ Cash only, no receipts (no paper trail)
- ✅ Refer serious injuries to licensed professionals

**Why:** Operating as unlicensed PT = criminal offense. But helping friends with wellness massage while studying = low risk.

### **2. Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to do 15 sessions/month with AMAZING quality → clients rebook + refer
- Than 30 sessions/month with mediocre quality → clients never return + bad reputation

**Your reputation takes 12 months to build, 1 bad session to destroy.**

### **3. Continuous Improvement**
- Watch 1-2 YouTube tutorials per week (massage techniques)
- Ask for feedback after every session
- Track what clients love (e.g., "everyone loves massage gun on glutes")
- Improve one skill per month

### **4. Client Relationships**
- Treat every client like a VIP (even if they're paying friend rates)
- Follow up after sessions (shows you care)
- Remember details (their job, hobbies, which muscles hurt)
- Be reliable (always on time, never cancel last-minute)

**Happy clients = repeat bookings + referrals = sustainable income**

### **5. Financial Discipline**
- Track EVERY peso (income + expenses)
- Separate "business money" from "personal money" mentally
- Resist urge to spend all income (you're saving for Month 13 launch!)
- Goal: Save 60-70% of net income (Gs. 1.5M/month → save Gs. 1M)

### **6. Patience & Consistency**
- Month 1 will be tough (learning + startup costs)
- Month 2-3 gets easier (repeat clients, less outreach needed)
- Month 4-6 = smooth sailing (consistent income)
- Month 7-12 = optimization (maximize savings)

**Don't quit after a rough Month 1. It gets MUCH better.**

---

## 🎯 YOUR IMMEDIATE GOALS (FIRST 30 DAYS)

**By end of Month 1, you should have:**

| Goal | Target | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Sessions completed** | 12-16 | Proves you can do this consistently |
| **Income earned** | Gs. 700K-1.1M | Validates business model works |
| **Net profit** | Gs. 300K-500K | After covering startup costs |
| **Active clients** | 10-15 | Solid base to build from |
| **Repeat clients** | 4-6 (40%) | Shows quality is good |
| **Referrals** | 1-3 | Network starting to grow |
| **Tracking system** | 100% up-to-date | Professional habits established |

**If you hit 80%+ of these targets → you're crushing it!** 🎉

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (STOP & REASSESS IF ANY OF THESE HAPPEN)

**Week 1-2:**
- ❌ Zero sessions completed → Reach out to more friends, adjust approach
- ❌ Clients don't rebook (0% repeat rate) → Ask for feedback, improve quality
- ❌ Friends say "too expensive" → Consider lowering price for first clients
- ❌ You feel unsafe/uncomfortable during sessions → Establish better boundaries

**Week 3-4:**
- ❌ Still under 8 sessions/month → Need more marketing or better service
- ❌ Negative feedback from multiple clients → Major skill gap, get help/training
- ❌ Running out of money (startup costs too high) → Cut expenses, find cheaper supplies
- ❌ Legal concerns (someone asks "are you licensed?") → Improve disclosure script

**Month 3-6:**
- ❌ Income plateaued or declining → Need referrals or raise prices
- ❌ Burning out (too many sessions) → Reduce volume, charge more
- ❌ No savings (spending everything) → Budget review, cut personal expenses

**Month 9-12:**
- ❌ Less than Gs. 10M saved → Won't have enough for post-license launch (need to adjust)
- ❌ No plan for graduation transition → Read `POST-LICENSE-TRANSITION-PLAN.md` NOW
- ❌ Still doing same volume as Month 1 → Should be growing, optimize strategy

**If ANY red flag appears: STOP, reassess, ask for help if needed, adjust strategy.**
