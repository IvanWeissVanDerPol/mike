---

## 🚗 PHASE 2: TRAVEL & ARRIVAL (10-15 Min)

### **During Travel:**

- [ ] Review client's notes (if repeat client: what did you work on last time?)
- [ ] Mental preparation:
  - "I'm here to help them relax and feel better"

  - "If I don't know something, I'll be honest"

### **Upon Arrival:**

- [ ] Arrive 5-10 min early (never late!)
- [ ] Message: "Hola! Ya estoy llegando 😊"
- [ ] Greet warmly (smile, confident but relaxed)
- [ ] Thank them for having you

**First Impression Script:**
> "Hola [Name]! Gracias por recibirme. ¿Cómo estás? Traje todo lo necesario, solo necesitamos un espacio tranquilo donde podamos trabajar cómodos. ¿Dónde te parece mejor?"

---

## 🛋️ PHASE 3: SETUP (5-10 Min)

### **Space Selection:**

**Ideal space:**
- [ ] Quiet room (away from TV, family traffic)
- [ ] Bed, couch, or floor with yoga mat
- [ ] Enough room for you to move around client
- [ ] Can be darkened slightly (close curtains, dim lights)

**Ask client:**
> "¿Tenés un lugar tranquilo donde te sientas cómodo? Puede ser tu cama, un sofá grande, o el piso con una colchoneta. Donde vos prefieras."

### **Setup Checklist:**

- [ ] **Wash your hands** (ask for bathroom, use soap + water, then sanitizer)
- [ ] **Prepare the surface:**

  - Lighting: "¿Apago la luz o está bien así?"

---

## 💬 PHASE 4: INTAKE CONVERSATION (5-7 Min)

### **CRITICAL: Information Gathering + Expectation Setting**

**Before touching the client, ask these questions:**

### **Health & Safety Questions:**

1. "¿Tenés alguna lesión reciente o dolor fuerte en alguna parte?" 
   - If YES to serious injury → STOP, refer to licensed PT
   - If minor tension/soreness → OK to proceed

2. "¿Alguna cirugía reciente? ¿Fracturas? ¿Problemas de piel?"
   - If YES → Avoid that area completely

3. "¿Alergias a aceites o cremas?"
   - If YES → Ask what oil they prefer (or work without oil, dry massage)

4. "¿Estás embarazada?" (if female client)
   - If YES → Gentle pressure only, avoid abdomen, consult first

5. "¿Tomás algún medicamento anticoagulante?" (blood thinners)
   - If YES → Light pressure only (bruises easily)

### **Expectation Setting Questions:**

6. "¿Qué zona te molesta más hoy? ¿Espalda, cuello, piernas?"
   - Client tells you where to focus

7. "¿Querés un masaje más fuerte o más suave?"
   - Gauge their pressure preference (start lighter, can add more)

8. "¿Alguna vez tuviste un masaje profesional antes?"
   - If NO → Explain what you'll do, set expectations
   - If YES → Ask what they liked/didn't like

### **Disclosure Script (CRITICAL - Say This EVERY TIME):**

> "Perfecto. Antes de empezar, te aclaro: yo estoy terminando mi carrera de Fisioterapia (me gradúo en enero 2027), así que todavía no soy profesional licenciada. Lo que voy a hacer hoy es un **masaje deportivo de relajación y estiramiento**, NO es un tratamiento médico. Si tenés algo serio, te voy a derivar con un profesional. ¿Estamos de acuerdo?"

**Wait for them to say YES or nod.**

This protects you legally (informed consent).

---

### **⚠️ RED FLAGS - STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:**

- [ ] Client is crying from pain (not relaxation tears, but actual pain)

**If any of these happen:**
1. Stop the massage
2. Ask: "¿Estás bien? ¿Qué sentís?"
3. If serious, recommend they see a doctor/licensed PT
4. If minor, adjust pressure and continue gently

## ⚠️ PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES (CRITICAL)

### **What TO DO:**

✅ Be friendly, warm, professional  
✅ Focus on the work  
✅ Respect their space and privacy  
✅ If they fall asleep during massage → that's a compliment! (means they're relaxed)  
✅ If they make small talk → answer briefly, but keep focus on massage  

### **What NOT TO DO:**

❌ Never work on someone who's drunk/high (liability risk)  
❌ Never massage someone in a bedroom alone if you feel uncomfortable (suggest living room)  
❌ Never gossip about other clients  
❌ Never post client photos without explicit permission  
❌ Never date clients (keep it professional)  
❌ Never promise "cures" or medical outcomes ("This will fix your herniated disc" ❌)  

### **If Client Makes You Uncomfortable:**

- Finish the session professionally but quickly (shorten to 30 min, say you have another appointment)
- Don't book future sessions ("I'm fully booked for the next few weeks")
- Don't ghost them (unprofessional), but don't explain either (protect yourself)
- Trust your instincts - if something feels off, it probably is

---

## 🏆 SESSION SUCCESS = Client Says This:

> "Eso estuvo increíble! Me siento mucho mejor. ¿Cuándo podés volver?"

**That's your goal. Every. Single. Time.**
