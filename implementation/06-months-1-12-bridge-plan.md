## PART 1: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR STUDENTS

### **What Mike CAN Do (No License Required)**

| Service Type | Legal? | Requirements | Marketing Terms | Risk Level |
|--------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Assistant under licensed PT** | ✅ YES | Supervision by matriculado | "Practicante", "Asistente" | 🟢 ZERO |
| **Personal training** | ✅ YES | RUC + IRE RESIMPLE | "Entrenador Personal", "Fitness Coach" | 🟢 ZERO |
| **Sports massage** | ✅ YES | RUC + IRE RESIMPLE | "Masaje Deportivo", "Masajista" | 🟡 LOW |
| **Wellness coaching** | ✅ YES | RUC + IRE RESIMPLE | "Coach de Bienestar", "Wellness" | 🟢 ZERO |
| **Corporate wellness** | ✅ YES | RUC + IRE RESIMPLE | "Pausas Activas", "Prevención" | 🟢 ZERO |
| **Stretching assistance** | ✅ YES | None (can be informal) | "Estiramiento Asistido" | 🟢 ZERO |

**Source**: `referencias/marco-legal.md` + Paraguay regulatory framework

### **What Mike CANNOT Do (Requires License)**

| Prohibited Activity | Why Illegal | Consequence | Risk |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Independent consultorio** | Requires matrícula MSPBS | Criminal offense | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Home PT visits (as professional)** | Ejercicio ilegal de la profesión | Fines + career damage | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Sign clinical histories** | Only matriculados can sign medical docs | Legal liability | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Use title "Fisioterapeuta"** | False professional title | Criminal fraud | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Treat pathologies independently** | Requires medical oversight | Malpractice liability | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Issue medical prescriptions** | Reserved for licensed professionals | Criminal offense | 🔴 HIGH |

### **The Gray Area (Work with Friends/Known Persons)**

**Question**: Can Mike help friends who know he's unlicensed?

**Legal Reality**:
- **Technically illegal** if treating medical conditions
- **Low enforcement risk** if:
  - Client fully aware of student status
  - No formal invoicing as "fisioterapia"
  - No claims of professional diagnosis/treatment
  - Framed as "helping a friend practice"
  
**Practical Strategy**:
- Call it "práctica supervisada" (practice sessions)
- Charge for "tiempo y materiales" not "tratamiento"
- Have them sign informal waiver acknowledging student status
- Don't advertise publicly
- Keep under Gs. 1M/month to stay low-profile

**Risk Level**: 🟡 LOW (if discreet and consensual)

**Recommended Approach**: Use this only for close trusted contacts, primary income from legal tracks.

## PART 8: RISK MITIGATION

### **Legal Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **MSPBS complaint (unlicensed practice)** | LOW (if following plan) | Never use "Fisioterapeuta" title, stay in wellness zone |
| **Client injury during session** | MEDIUM | Have verbal consent, don't treat serious conditions, refer to licensed PT |
| **Tax audit** | LOW | Keep proper RUC/RESIMPLE records for wellness income |
| **Friend/client complaint** | LOW | Only work with people who know your student status |

### **Financial Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Can't find assistant job** | LOW | Apply to 20+ places, willing to take lower salary |
| **Wellness services don't take off** | MEDIUM | Start small, part-time only, low capital at risk |
| **Bank loan rejection** | HIGH | Don't depend on it, use assistant salary + savings |
| **Insufficient Month 1 income** | LOW (with assistant job) | Assistant job covers minimum needs |

### **Reputational Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Perceived as "fake PT"** | MEDIUM | Be transparent about student status, frame as pre-launch |
| **Undercutting future pricing** | LOW | Wellness services ≠ PT services, different markets |
| **Employer finds out about side work** | MEDIUM | Ensure wellness work doesn't conflict with assistant hours |

| Red Flag | Action |

| **Month 6: No wellness traction** | Pivot to 100% assistant work + aggressive saving |
| **Month 9: < Gs. 10M saved** | Delay launch OR pursue Scenario 1 only (cheapest) |
| **Any legal complaint** | STOP wellness immediately, consult lawyer |

---

## PART 11: CONTINGENCY PLANS

### **Scenario A: Can't Find Assistant Job**

**Pivot**:
1. Double-down on wellness services (30 hrs/week instead of 10)
2. Target income: Gs. 3-4M/month (aggressive client acquisition)
3. Work as gym instructor (legal, Gs. 1.5-2M/month)
4. Delay full launch by 6 months to save capital

### **Scenario B: Bank Loan Rejected**

**Impact**: Reduced wellness capital (Gs. 3M → Gs. 1M available)

**Mitigation**:
1. Start wellness with minimal equipment (Gs. 1M)
2. Focus on services requiring no equipment (stretching, training)
3. Save 100% of wellness income for equipment purchases
4. Month 3: Buy massage table (Gs. 800K) from savings
5. Month 6: Buy full equipment package from savings

### **Scenario C: Wellness Services Illegal Complaint**

**If MSPBS or tax authority challenges**:
1. STOP all wellness services immediately
2. Provide evidence of proper RUC/RESIMPLE registration
3. Show marketing materials (no medical claims)
4. Worst case: Pay fine (Gs. 500K-1M), cease wellness
5. Rely 100% on assistant income + wait for graduation

### **Scenario D: Graduation Delayed**

**If graduation pushed to June 2027 (6-month delay)**:
1. Continue assistant + wellness work (income stream stable)
2. Delay launch timeline by 6 months
3. BENEFIT: More capital saved (Gs. 30M → Gs. 40M+)
4. BENEFIT: Larger network built
