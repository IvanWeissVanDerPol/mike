2. **Tomorrow:** Visit one department store for towels, hygiene, bag (all in one place)

**Total time:** 1-2 hours

---

## ✅ POST-SHOPPING CHECKLIST

Once you have everything:

- [ ] Wash all towels before first use (remove factory chemicals)
- [ ] Organize carrying bag:
  - Oils in sealed compartment (prevent leaks)
  - Clean towels in one section
  - Used towels separate bag (bring plastic bag for dirty towels)
  - Massage gun + charger
  - Hand sanitizer easily accessible
  - Pillows (if they fit, otherwise bring separately)
- [ ] Test everything: Does it all fit comfortably in the bag?
- [ ] Practice carrying the bag: Is it too heavy? (adjust if needed)

---

## 🔄 RESUPPLY SCHEDULE (After You Start)

**Weekly (After 4-6 sessions):**
- Wash all towels
- Check oil levels (refill when below 500ml)

**Monthly:**
- Buy more oil (1L per month if doing 16-20 sessions)
- Replace wipes/sanitizer as needed

**Every 3 Months:**
- Evaluate towel condition (replace if worn/stained)
- Upgrade equipment if income allows

---

## 💡 MONEY-SAVING TIPS

1. **Oils:** Start with coconut (cheaper), upgrade to almond later when income is steady
2. **Towels:** Buy 6 instead of 8 initially, add 2 more in Month 2
3. **Bag:** Reuse a backpack or gym bag you already have (save Gs. 30-80K)
4. **Wipes:** Buy alcohol (cheaper) + cotton pads instead of pre-made wipes
5. **Ask friends:** "Does anyone have extra towels I can borrow/buy cheap?"

---

## 🚨 DON'T BUY THESE YET (Wait Until Month 2-3)

❌ Massage table/mat (Gs. 200K-600K) - Friends' beds are fine for now  
❌ Essential oils for aromatherapy (Gs. 50K-100K) - Nice-to-have, not essential  
❌ Professional linens (Gs. 100K-150K) - Towels work fine  
❌ Bluetooth speaker (Gs. 80K-150K) - Use your phone  
❌ Fancy massage lotions (Gs. 50K+) - Basic oil works great  

**Why wait?** Validate demand first. After 10-15 sessions and Gs. 800K-1.2M income, THEN upgrade.

---

## ✅ READY TO SHOP?

**Before you go:**
1. Print this checklist (or save on phone)
2. Bring exact budget in cash (easier to negotiate)
3. Bring WhatsApp to compare prices (Google "aceite masajes precio Paraguay" while shopping)
4. Ask for bulk discounts EVERYWHERE (worst they say is no)

**After shopping:**
1. Take photos of receipts (track expenses)
2. Update your expense tracker (file #4)
3. Mark this task COMPLETE ✅
4. Move to next file: `CLIENT-TRACKING-SPREADSHEET-TEMPLATE.md`

## 📊 SAMPLE ANALYSIS (After Month 1)

**Insights:**
- ✅ Average Gs. 70K per session (between Tier 1 and Tier 2 pricing)
- ✅ 4 sessions/week average (on track for Month 2 goal of 5/week)
- ⚠️ 33% retention is low - need to follow up with clients after first session

### **1 Hour Before Session:**

- [ ] **Confirm with client (WhatsApp):**
  ```
  Hola [Name]! Confirmo que nos vemos hoy a las [time] en [address]. 
  Voy a estar llegando 5-10 min antes para preparar todo. 
  ¿Algún cambio? 😊
  ```

- [ ] **Personal preparation:**

  - [ ] Trim your nails SHORT (will touch client's skin)
  - [ ] Tie hair back if long (hygienic, won't get in way)
  - [ ] Light meal (don't work on empty stomach, but not too full)
  - [ ] Use bathroom before leaving

- [ ] **Check address:**
  - [ ] Know exact location (Google Maps screenshot)
  - [ ] Estimate Uber cost (if charging client for transport)
  - [ ] Have backup plan (if they're not home, etc.)

---

## 🚗 PHASE 2: TRAVEL & ARRIVAL (10-15 Min)

### **During Travel:**

- [ ] Review client's notes (if repeat client: what did you work on last time?)
- [ ] Mental preparation:
  - "I'm here to help them relax and feel better"
  - "I'll do my best with what I know"
  - "If I don't know something, I'll be honest"

### **Upon Arrival:**

- [ ] Arrive 5-10 min early (never late!)
- [ ] Message: "Hola! Ya estoy llegando 😊"
- [ ] Greet warmly (smile, confident but relaxed)
- [ ] Thank them for having you

**First Impression Script:**
> "Hola [Name]! Gracias por recibirme. ¿Cómo estás? Traje todo lo necesario, solo necesitamos un espacio tranquilo donde podamos trabajar cómodos. ¿Dónde te parece mejor?"

---

## 🛋️ PHASE 3: SETUP (5-10 Min)

### **Space Selection:**

**Ideal space:**
- [ ] Quiet room (away from TV, family traffic)
- [ ] Bed, couch, or floor with yoga mat
- [ ] Enough room for you to move around client
- [ ] Can be darkened slightly (close curtains, dim lights)

**Ask client:**
> "¿Tenés un lugar tranquilo donde te sientas cómodo? Puede ser tu cama, un sofá grande, o el piso con una colchoneta. Donde vos prefieras."

### **Setup Checklist:**

- [ ] **Wash your hands** (ask for bathroom, use soap + water, then sanitizer)
- [ ] **Prepare the surface:**
  - If bed: Have them lie directly on their sheets (you'll use your towels on top)
  - If floor: Lay down towel first as base layer
  - Position pillows (one for head, one for under knees if lying face-up)

- [ ] **Organize your supplies nearby:**
  - Oil bottle within arm's reach (won't spill)
  - Towels stacked neatly
  - Massage gun plugged in or charged
  - Sanitizer accessible

- [ ] **Set the mood:**
  - Ask: "¿Te gusta la música mientras trabajo? ¿Qué tipo?" (play soft music from phone if yes)
  - Adjust room temperature: "¿Tenés frío o calor? Avísame si querés que abra/cierre la ventana"
  - Lighting: "¿Apago la luz o está bien así?"

---

## 💬 PHASE 4: INTAKE CONVERSATION (5-7 Min)

### **CRITICAL: Information Gathering + Expectation Setting**

**Before touching the client, ask these questions:**

### **Health & Safety Questions:**

1. "¿Tenés alguna lesión reciente o dolor fuerte en alguna parte?" 
   - If YES to serious injury → STOP, refer to licensed PT
   - If minor tension/soreness → OK to proceed

2. "¿Alguna cirugía reciente? ¿Fracturas? ¿Problemas de piel?"
   - If YES → Avoid that area completely

3. "¿Alergias a aceites o cremas?"
   - If YES → Ask what oil they prefer (or work without oil, dry massage)

4. "¿Estás embarazada?" (if female client)
   - If YES → Gentle pressure only, avoid abdomen, consult first

5. "¿Tomás algún medicamento anticoagulante?" (blood thinners)
   - If YES → Light pressure only (bruises easily)

### **Expectation Setting Questions:**

6. "¿Qué zona te molesta más hoy? ¿Espalda, cuello, piernas?"
   - Client tells you where to focus

7. "¿Querés un masaje más fuerte o más suave?"
   - Gauge their pressure preference (start lighter, can add more)

8. "¿Alguna vez tuviste un masaje profesional antes?"
   - If NO → Explain what you'll do, set expectations
   - If YES → Ask what they liked/didn't like

### **Disclosure Script (CRITICAL - Say This EVERY TIME):**

> "Perfecto. Antes de empezar, te aclaro: yo estoy terminando mi carrera de Fisioterapia (me gradúo en enero 2027), así que todavía no soy profesional licenciada. Lo que voy a hacer hoy es un **masaje deportivo de relajación y estiramiento**, NO es un tratamiento médico. Si tenés algo serio, te voy a derivar con un profesional. ¿Estamos de acuerdo?"

**Wait for them to say YES or nod.**

This protects you legally (informed consent).

## 🙌 PHASE 5: THE MASSAGE SESSION (45-60 Min)

### **GENERAL FLOW (Customize Based on Client's Needs)**

**Time allocation:**
- 15-20 min: Primary area of complaint (e.g., lower back)
- 15-20 min: Secondary area (e.g., shoulders/neck)
- 10-15 min: Additional areas or full-body relaxation
- 5 min: Stretching/cool-down

---

### **OPTION A: FULL BODY RELAXATION MASSAGE**

**Client starts:** Face down (boca abajo)

1. **Back (10-15 min):**
   - [ ] Apply oil to your hands (warm it by rubbing hands together)
   - [ ] Long, smooth strokes down the back (effleurage)
   - [ ] Knead shoulder muscles (trapezius) - most people have tension here
   - [ ] Work down spine (avoid pressing directly on spine bones!)
   - [ ] Lower back: circular motions, gentle pressure
   - [ ] Use massage gun on tight spots (low setting first, increase if they tolerate)

2. **Legs - Posterior (10 min):**
   - [ ] One leg at a time
   - [ ] Hamstrings: long strokes from knee to glute
   - [ ] Calves: knead gently (gastroc + soleus muscles)
   - [ ] Glutes: firm pressure (many people carry tension here)
   - [ ] Use massage gun on IT band (outer thigh) if tight

**Client flips:** Face up (boca arriba)

3. **Legs - Anterior (10 min):**
   - [ ] Quadriceps: long strokes from knee to hip
   - [ ] Shins/tibialis: gentle pressure (not much muscle here)
   - [ ] Feet (if they want): arch of foot, gentle ankle rotation

4. **Arms (5-7 min):**
   - [ ] Shoulders: circular motions (deltoids)
   - [ ] Biceps/triceps: long strokes
   - [ ] Forearms: knead (especially if they work at computer)
   - [ ] Hands: palm pressure, finger pulls (very relaxing!)

5. **Neck/Head (5-7 min):**
   - [ ] Support head with one hand, work neck with other
   - [ ] Gentle pressure on neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes)
   - [ ] Scalp massage (if they like it): circular motions, feels amazing
   - [ ] Temples: gentle circular pressure (relieves headaches)

---

### **OPTION B: SPORTS RECOVERY MASSAGE (Athlete/Active Client)**

**Focus:** Muscle tension relief, improve circulation, prevent injury

1. **Assessment (2-3 min):**
   - Ask: "¿Qué deporte hacés? ¿Cuándo fue tu último entrenamiento?"
   - Look for obvious tight areas (they'll tell you)

2. **Warm-Up (5 min):**
   - Broad, sweeping strokes to increase blood flow
   - Light pressure initially

3. **Deep Tissue Work (20-25 min):**
   - Target problem areas (e.g., runners: IT band, calves, hip flexors)
   - Use thumbs, forearms, massage gun
   - **Ask frequently:** "¿Está bien la presión?" (pain should be 6/10 max, not 10/10!)

4. **Stretching (10-15 min):**
   - Assisted stretches:
     - Hamstring stretch (gently push leg toward chest while they're face-up)
     - Hip flexor stretch
     - Shoulder stretch
   - Hold each stretch 20-30 seconds
   - **Never force!** Gentle resistance only

5. **Cool-Down (5 min):**
   - Light strokes to relax muscles
   - Finish with calming touch

---

### **OPTION C: TENSION RELIEF (Office Worker/Stress)**

**Focus:** Neck, shoulders, upper back (where stress accumulates)

1. **Upper Back & Shoulders (20 min):**
   - Client face down
   - Focus entirely on upper trapezius, rhomboids, levator scapulae
   - These muscles are ALWAYS tight in office workers
   - Use massage gun on trigger points

2. **Neck (10 min):**
   - Client face up
   - Support head, work on neck muscles
   - Be GENTLE on neck (never forceful)

3. **Scalp & Face (5-7 min):**
   - Scalp massage: circular motions, light pressure
   - Temples, forehead, jaw (TMJ tension is common)

4. **Arms/Hands (8-10 min):**
   - Forearms get tight from typing
   - Hand massage feels incredible for office workers

5. **Lower Back (Optional, 5-7 min):**
   - If they sit a lot, lower back will be tight
   - Gentle pressure, avoid spine

---

### **🔥 MASSAGE GUN USAGE (Your Secret Weapon!)**

**When to use:**
- Tight muscle knots (trigger points)
- After warming up area with hands
- Never on bones, joints, or spine

**How to use:**
1. Start on lowest setting
2. Move slowly across muscle (don't stay in one spot)
3. Ask: "¿Está bien o muy fuerte?"
4. Increase setting only if they tolerate
5. Max 2-3 minutes per area (avoid overstimulation)

**Best areas for massage gun:**
- Glutes (very effective)
- IT band (outer thigh)
- Calves
- Upper back (trapezius)
- Quadriceps

**NEVER use on:**
- Neck (too delicate)
- Directly on spine
- Joints (knees, elbows)
- Abdomen
- Areas with acute injury

---

### **⚠️ RED FLAGS - STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:**

- [ ] Client says pain is 8-10/10 (you're pressing too hard)
- [ ] Client feels nauseous, dizzy, or faint (STOP, have them sit up slowly, give water)
- [ ] You see bruising appearing (you're too rough)
- [ ] Client is crying from pain (not relaxation tears, but actual pain)
- [ ] You feel a "lump" or unusual mass (could be medical, refer to doctor)
- [ ] Client has sharp, shooting pain (could be nerve issue, STOP)

**If any of these happen:**
1. Stop the massage
2. Ask: "¿Estás bien? ¿Qué sentís?"
3. If serious, recommend they see a doctor/licensed PT
4. If minor, adjust pressure and continue gently

---

## 🧘 PHASE 6: COOL-DOWN (3-5 Min)

**Transition from massage to end:**

- [ ] Final light strokes (calming, slower movements)
- [ ] Cover client with towel (if they're cold)
- [ ] Lower music volume
- [ ] Let them "wake up" slowly

**Say:**
> "Voy terminando. Quedate tranquilo/a unos minutos. Cuando estés listo/a, levantate despacio para no marearte."

**While they rest (1-2 min):**
- [ ] Put away massage gun
- [ ] Cap oil bottle
- [ ] Organize towels

**When they sit up:**
- [ ] Offer water (ask if they have water nearby)
- [ ] Give stretching advice:
  > "Te recomiendo hacer estos estiramientos en los próximos días [show 2-3 simple stretches]. Y tomá bastante agua hoy, ayuda a eliminar toxinas."

---

## 💰 PHASE 7: WRAP-UP & PAYMENT (5 Min)

### **Feedback:**

- [ ] Ask: "¿Cómo te sentís? ¿Alguna molestia?"
- [ ] Listen to their response (take mental notes)
- [ ] If they loved it: "Me alegro! ¿Querés que agendemos otra sesión?"

### **Payment:**

- [ ] Be direct but friendly: "Bueno, son Gs. [60K/80K/100K] por hoy."
- [ ] Accept cash (count it discreetly)
- [ ] If they don't have exact change: "No pasa nada, la próxima me compensás" (build goodwill)
- [ ] **DO NOT** issue receipt (informal arrangement)

### **Next Booking:**

- [ ] If they want to book again: "¿Qué día te viene bien la semana que viene?"
- [ ] Confirm on the spot (pull out phone, check calendar)
- [ ] If they're unsure: "Dale, avisame durante la semana cuando sepas tus horarios."

### **Referral Ask (If They Loved It):**

> "Me alegra que te haya gustado! Si conocés a alguien que también podría beneficiarse, avisales que estoy ofreciendo estas sesiones mientras termino mi carrera. Te agradezco un montón cualquier referencia 😊"

### **Pack Up:**

- [ ] Put used towels in plastic bag (separate from clean ones)
- [ ] Put away all supplies
- [ ] Leave the space as you found it (or better)
- [ ] Thank them again

**Final words:**
> "Gracias por la confianza, [Name]! Cualquier cosa me escribís. Cuidate y tomá agua! 😊"

---

## 📱 PHASE 8: POST-SESSION (10-15 Min)

### **Immediately After Leaving:**

- [ ] Message the client (within 2 hours):
  ```
  Hola [Name]! Gracias de vuelta por hoy. 
  Espero que te sientas mejor. 
  Si tenés alguna molestia o pregunta, avisame. 
  Saludos! 😊
  ```

### **On the Way Home / When You Get Home:**

- [ ] **Update your tracker:**
  - [ ] Log session in Session Log (Client name, date, service, price, paid)
  - [ ] Update Client Master List (increment total sessions)
  - [ ] Add to Weekly Income (Gs. amount)
  - [ ] Write notes while fresh in memory:
    - What did you work on?
    - What did client love?
    - What could you improve next time?
    - Any red flags or concerns?

- [ ] **Wash towels immediately** (or same day)
  - Oil stains set if you wait
  - Use hot water + detergent
  - Dry completely before next use

- [ ] **Recharge massage gun** (so it's ready for next session)

- [ ] **Refill your bag**:
  - Replace used towels with clean ones
  - Check oil level (refill bottle if below 100ml)
  - Sanitizer/wipes still stocked?

  - Search: "sports massage techniques," "trigger point release," "massage for [specific area]"
  - Learn one new technique per week

- [ ] Practice on yourself or family member
  - Test new techniques before using on paying clients

### **After Every 10 Sessions:**

- [ ] Ask for honest feedback:
  > "Hola! Quiero mejorar mi trabajo. ¿Me podés decir qué te gustó más y qué podría hacer mejor? Cualquier comentario me ayuda un montón. Gracias!"

- [ ] Calculate your stats:
  - Average session duration (are you going over time?)
  - Client satisfaction rate (how many rebook?)
  - Income per hour (is it worth your time?)

---

## ⚠️ PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES (CRITICAL)

### **What TO DO:**

✅ Be friendly, warm, professional  
✅ Focus on the work  
✅ Respect their space and privacy  
✅ If they fall asleep during massage → that's a compliment! (means they're relaxed)  
✅ If they make small talk → answer briefly, but keep focus on massage  

### **What NOT TO DO:**

❌ Never work on someone who's drunk/high (liability risk)  
❌ Never massage someone in a bedroom alone if you feel uncomfortable (suggest living room)  
❌ Never gossip about other clients  
❌ Never post client photos without explicit permission  
❌ Never date clients (keep it professional)  
❌ Never promise "cures" or medical outcomes ("This will fix your herniated disc" ❌)  

### **If Client Makes You Uncomfortable:**

- Finish the session professionally but quickly (shorten to 30 min, say you have another appointment)
- Don't book future sessions ("I'm fully booked for the next few weeks")
- Don't ghost them (unprofessional), but don't explain either (protect yourself)
- Trust your instincts - if something feels off, it probably is

---

## 🏆 SESSION SUCCESS = Client Says This:

> "Eso estuvo increíble! Me siento mucho mejor. ¿Cuándo podés volver?"

**That's your goal. Every. Single. Time.**

## 🚫 HANDLING REJECTIONS & DIFFICULT SITUATIONS

### **If They Say "Too Expensive"**

```
Entiendo [Nombre]! 

Para que sepas, el precio de clínicas profesionales está en Gs. 120-170K por sesión. Yo cobro menos porque estoy practicando todavía.

Si querés, puedo hacer una excepción y cobrarte Gs. [50K/70K] (precio especial para vos), pero solo si realmente te sirve. 

Sino, todo bien! No hay presión 😊
```

### **If They Say "I'll Think About It"**

```
Dale [Nombre], sin drama! 

Si eventualmente te interesa, avisame. Si no, todo bien también 😊

Seguimos en contacto! 🙌
```

### **If They Ask for FREE Session**

```
Te entiendo [Nombre], pero lamentablemente no puedo hacer sesiones gratis porque invierto en aceites, transporte, y mi tiempo.

Lo que sí puedo hacer es cobrarte Gs. [precio más bajo que el normal] en vez de [precio normal], ¿te sirve eso?
```

### **If They Want to Negotiate Price**

```
[Nombre], entiendo que Gs. [precio] puede parecer mucho. 

Puedo hacer Gs. [10-20K menos] si es más cómodo para vos. Pero ese sería el mínimo porque tengo que cubrir materiales y transporte.

¿Te sirve ese precio? 😊
```

### **If They're Not Responding (After 2 Messages)**

```
Hola [Nombre]! 

Vi que no respondiste mis últimos mensajes. Asumo que no te interesa por ahora, ¡todo bien! 😊

Si en algún momento te interesa, avisame. Sino, seguimos en contacto igual. 

Saludos! 🙌
```

## ⚠️ PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES

### **If They Ask for "Physiotherapy Treatment"**

```
[Nombre], te agradezco la confianza, pero como todavía no tengo mi licencia profesional, no puedo ofrecer tratamiento de fisioterapia para [lesión específica].

Lo que puedo hacer es masaje de relajación y estiramiento para aliviar tensión general. Pero para algo específico como [lesión], te recomiendo ver a un fisioterapeuta licenciado.

¿Querés que te refiera a alguno? 😊
```

### **If They Ask You to "Fix" a Serious Injury**

```
[Nombre], para [lesión seria] realmente necesitás ver a un profesional licenciado. Yo no puedo tratar eso porque todavía no tengo mi título.

Te puedo pasar el contacto de [Fisioterapeuta licenciado] que es muy bueno/a. 

Cuando me gradúe en enero 2027, ahí sí voy a poder ayudarte con eso! 😊
```

### **If They Want Receipt/Invoice**

```
[Nombre], como todavía estoy estudiando y esto es práctica informal, no emito recibos.

Si necesitás algo formal para tu seguro o algo así, tendrías que ir a una clínica con fisioterapeutas licenciados.

Espero que entiendas! 😊
```

❌ Send messages late at night (after 9pm) or early morning (before 8am)  
❌ Be pushy or aggressive ("You NEED to book NOW!")  
❌ Overshare personal problems  
❌ Gossip about other clients  
❌ Send too many follow-ups (2 max, then stop)
