# 🛡️ RISK MANAGEMENT & SAFETY PROTOCOLS

**Purpose:** Protect yourself legally, financially, and physically  
**Reality:** Working alone in clients' homes = inherent risks  
**Approach:** Prepare for worst-case, hope for best-case

---

## ⚖️ LEGAL PROTECTION

### **Problem: You're Practicing Without a License**

**Legal Reality:**
- ✅ Wellness massage for friends (disclosed status) = Low risk
- ⚠️ Treating injuries/pain = Medium risk (gray area)
- ❌ Claiming to be a "fisioterapeuta" = HIGH risk (criminal offense)

**How to stay safe:**

#### **1. ALWAYS Use This Disclaimer (Before EVERY Session)**

```
"Before we start, I need to make sure you understand:

I'm a final-year physiotherapy student. I graduate in January 2027, 
so I'm NOT a licensed professional yet.

What I'm offering today is wellness massage for relaxation and 
practice - it's NOT medical treatment.

If you have serious pain, injuries, or medical conditions, you 
should see a licensed physiotherapist or doctor.

Do you understand and agree to proceed?"
```

**Get them to say "YES" out loud before touching them.**

**Why this works:**
- Informed consent (they know the risk)
- Protects you if something goes wrong
- Shows professional standards

---

#### **2. Written Consent Form (Recommended)**

**Create simple form (handwritten or typed):**

```
CONSENT FOR WELLNESS MASSAGE PRACTICE SESSION

I, [CLIENT NAME], understand that:

1. Mikie Moyano Nakamura is a physiotherapy STUDENT (not licensed)
2. This is wellness massage for practice, NOT medical treatment
3. I have no serious injuries or medical conditions requiring professional care
4. I voluntarily consent to this practice session
5. I will not hold Mikie liable for any discomfort or issues arising from this session

Signature: ________________  Date: ________________
```

**When to use:**
- New clients (first session)
- Clients with ANY medical history
- Clients you don't know well

**When NOT needed:**
- Very close friends who fully trust you
- Repeat clients (signed once = valid ongoing)

---

#### **3. What NOT to Say (NEVER)**

❌ "I can fix your injury"  
❌ "This will cure your pain"  
❌ "I'm basically a fisioterapeuta"  
❌ "Trust me, I know what I'm doing"  
❌ "You don't need to see a doctor"

✅ "I can help you relax"  
✅ "Let's see if this reduces tension"  
✅ "I'm practicing techniques I learned"  
✅ "If it doesn't improve, see a licensed PT"  
✅ "For serious issues, definitely get professional care"

---

#### **4. When to REFUSE Service**

**RED FLAGS (Don't Work With Them):**
- Client is drunk or high
- Client has acute injury (happened <48 hours ago)
- Client has serious medical condition (recent surgery, heart problems, etc.)
- Client makes you uncomfortable (gut feeling = trust it)
- Client wants you to "treat" specific diagnosis (herniated disc, etc.)
- Client refuses to sign consent / acknowledge student status

**What to say:**
> "I don't feel comfortable working on this. For your safety, you should see a licensed professional. I can recommend [licensed PT name if you know one]."

---

## 💰 PAYMENT PROTECTION

### **Problem: Friends "Forget" to Pay or Cancel Last Minute**

**Reality:**
- 10-20% of friends will conveniently "forget" cash
- 20-30% will cancel within 24 hours of session
- 5-10% will ghost after booking

**How to protect yourself:**

#### **1. Prepayment Policy (Recommended After Month 2)**

**How it works:**
> "To confirm your booking, I need payment in advance via Giros Tigo / bank transfer. This holds your slot."

**Benefits:**
- No-shows drop to near zero
- You don't waste time traveling
- Professional boundaries established

**When to implement:**
- Month 1: Skip this (build trust first)
- Month 2+: For new/unknown clients
- Always: For clients who've canceled before

---

#### **2. Cancellation Policy**

**Announce this upfront:**
> "If you need to cancel or reschedule, please let me know at least 24 hours before. 
> Same-day cancellations, I have to charge 50% (Gs. 30K) because I've already blocked that time."

**Why this works:**
- Sets clear expectations
- Reduces last-minute cancellations
- Trains clients to respect your time

**How to enforce:**
- First cancellation: Let it slide (be flexible)
- Second cancellation: Gently remind of policy
- Third cancellation: Stop working with them

---

#### **3. "Forgot Cash" Protocol**

**When client says "I forgot my wallet":**

**Bad response:** "Oh, no problem! Pay me next time."  
*(They never pay)*

**Good response:** "No worries! Can you transfer via Giros Tigo right now? Or I can wait while you grab cash."

**If they can't pay TODAY:**
> "I understand. Send me the payment by tonight, and we're good. If I don't receive it by tomorrow, I'll have to pause future bookings until this is settled."

**Follow-up:**
- If paid within 24 hours → All good
- If not paid within 48 hours → Send ONE reminder
- If not paid within 7 days → Write it off, never work with them again

---

## 🚨 PHYSICAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### **Problem: You're Going to Strangers' Homes Alone**

**Risks:**
- Inappropriate advances (sexual harassment)
- Theft (client steals from your bag)
- Assault (physical violence)
- Unsafe environments (aggressive dogs, unsafe neighborhood)

**How to stay safe:**

#### **1. Pre-Session Safety Check**

**Before accepting ANY new client:**
- [ ] Do you know them personally? (If no → higher risk)
- [ ] Has someone you trust vouched for them? (If no → higher risk)
- [ ] Are you meeting at their home? (Check address on Google Maps - safe area?)
- [ ] Will anyone else be there? (Alone = higher risk)

**RED FLAGS (Don't Go):**
- Client refuses to give full address until day-of
- Client wants session late at night (after 9 PM)
- Client makes inappropriate comments via WhatsApp
- Client insists "no one else can be home"
- Your gut says "this feels wrong"

**Trust your instincts. If it feels off, cancel.**

---

#### **2. Share Your Location**

**ALWAYS:**
- Tell a friend/family member where you're going
- Share live location via WhatsApp/Google Maps
- Set expected return time
- Check in after session ("I'm done, heading home")

**Template message to trusted friend:**
```
Going to massage session:
Client: [Name]
Address: [Full address]
Time: [Start time] - [Expected end time]
If you don't hear from me by [time + 2 hours], call me.
```

---

#### **3. During Session: Safety Rules**

✅ **DO:**
- Keep your phone charged and within reach
- Position yourself near the exit door (don't get trapped)
- Trust your gut (if it feels wrong, end session and leave)
- Maintain professional boundaries (no personal questions, no flirting)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Put your phone in another room
- Accept drinks/food (could be drugged)
- Work in a locked bedroom (unlocked spaces only)
- Continue if client is inappropriate (touching you, sexual comments)

---

#### **4. If Client Crosses Boundaries**

**Verbal harassment / inappropriate comments:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Say firmly: "That's not appropriate. I'm leaving."
3. Pack your things
4. Leave (don't argue)
5. Block them on WhatsApp
6. Never return

**Physical touching / assault:**
1. Say loudly: "STOP. DON'T TOUCH ME."
2. Leave immediately (don't pack, just go)
3. Call someone for pickup if needed
4. Consider filing police report (if severe)
5. Block them everywhere

**You don't owe anyone an explanation. Your safety > their feelings.**

---

## 🩹 INJURY PROTOCOLS

### **Problem: Client Gets Hurt During Session**

**Possible scenarios:**
- Muscle strain (you pressed too hard)
- Allergic reaction (oil sensitivity)
- Existing injury worsens
- Client faints/dizzy
- Client has panic attack

**Immediate response protocol:**

#### **1. STOP Immediately**

- Don't continue the session
- Don't try to "fix it"
- Don't panic

#### **2. Assess Severity**

**MINOR** (soreness, slight discomfort):
- Ask: "On a scale 1-10, how bad is it?"
- If 1-5: Probably normal
- Offer: Ice pack, rest, water
- Follow-up: Check in 24 hours later

**MODERATE** (sharp pain, limping, can't move part):
- Ask: "Can you move it? Where exactly does it hurt?"
- If 6-8: They should see a doctor
- Say: "I think you should get this checked by a professional. Do you want me to call someone?"
- Document: What happened, what you were doing

**SEVERE** (can't breathe, chest pain, passed out):
- **CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY**
- Don't move them (unless dangerous location)
- Stay until help arrives
- Document everything

#### **3. Document EVERYTHING**

**Write down immediately:**
- Date and time
- What technique you were using
- Where on body
- Client's exact words ("It felt like a sharp pain in my lower back")
- What you did in response
- Client's condition when you left

**Why:** If they sue you later, you have your version documented.

---

#### **4. Follow-Up**

**Next day:**
> "Hi [Name], just checking in after yesterday. How are you feeling? Any lingering pain or issues?"

**If they report problems:**
> "I recommend you see a doctor or licensed PT to make sure everything's okay. Let me know if there's anything I can do."

**If they threaten legal action:**
> "I understand you're upset. I take this seriously. Let's talk about how to resolve this."

*Then immediately consult with a lawyer if threat seems serious.*

## 🧠 MENTAL HEALTH & BURNOUT

### **Problem: Rejection, Failure, and Self-Doubt**

**Reality Check:**
- 50-70% of friends will say "no" or ghost you
- You'll have bad sessions where clients aren't satisfied
- You'll doubt yourself constantly ("Am I good enough?")
- You'll feel like quitting (multiple times)

**This is NORMAL. Every entrepreneur faces this.**

---

### **How to Manage Mental Health:**

#### **1. Expect Rejection**

**Mindset shift:**
- "No" is not personal rejection
- "No" is just "not right now" or "not for me"
- You need 10 "no"s to get 1 "yes"

**Exercise:**
- Set a goal: "Get 20 rejections this month"
- Celebrate each "no" (you're one closer to a "yes")
- Track your conversion rate (how many yes per 10 asks)

---

#### **2. Separate Self-Worth from Results**

**Bad thinking:** "If this fails, I'm a failure"  
**Good thinking:** "This is an experiment. If it fails, I learn."

**Remember:**
- Your value as a person ≠ your business results
- Failing at massage ≠ failing at physiotherapy
- This is practice, not your final career

---

#### **3. Build Support System**

**Who to talk to:**
- Friend who believes in you (cheerleader)
- Mentor who's done this before (advisor)
- Peer who's building something (accountability partner)

**What NOT to do:**
- Talk to negative people ("I told you this wouldn't work")
- Isolate yourself (process feelings alone)
- Ignore warning signs (persistent sadness, anxiety)

---

#### **4. When to Quit**

**Good reasons to stop:**
- You're making zero progress after 3 months of honest effort
- It's affecting your studies negatively
- Your mental health is suffering (depression, anxiety)
- You found a better opportunity (PT assistant job)

**Bad reasons to stop:**
- Had 2 bad sessions in a row
- 5 friends said no
- Feeling discouraged after 2 weeks

**Rule:** Give it 90 days of real effort before deciding to quit.
