# 💰 REALISTIC FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS (12-Month Student Bridge Plan)

> **For**: Mikie Moyano Nakamura (final-year PT student)  
> **Purpose**: Ground-truth financial expectations (NOT hockey-stick growth)  
> **Timeline**: January 2026 → January 2027 (12 months pre-license)  
> **Status**: ✅ Realistic scenarios with churn rates & probabilities

---

## ⚠️ WARNING: Why This File Exists

**Problem with original projections:**
- ❌ Assumed 20 friends all say yes
- ❌ Assumed ZERO client churn
- ❌ Assumed prices increase smoothly every month
- ❌ Assumed always fully booked
- ❌ Hockey-stick growth curve (unrealistic)

**Reality check:**
- ✅ Some friends will say "no" or "maybe later"
- ✅ Client churn is NORMAL (30-60% first year)
- ✅ Price increases meet resistance
- ✅ Demand fluctuates (exams, holidays, life)
- ✅ Growth is bumpy, not smooth

**This file:** Three scenarios with realistic assumptions + probabilities

---

## 📊 THREE SCENARIOS (Probability-Weighted)

| Scenario | Probability | Friends Who Try | Churn Rate | 12-Mo Savings | Can Launch Post-License? |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **PESSIMISTIC** | 30% | 5 | 60% | Gs. 5.7M | ⚠️ Need Plan B |
| **REALISTIC** | 50% | 10 | 40% | Gs. 14.8M | ✅ YES (Scenario 2) |
| **OPTIMISTIC** | 20% | 15 | 30% | Gs. 20.1M | ✅✅ YES (Scenario 1 or 2) |
| **EXPECTED VALUE** | 100% | - | - | **Gs. 13.13M** | ✅ Modest launch |

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Scenario Naming Caveat

**These scenarios are labeled relative to the ORIGINAL plan's assumptions, NOT absolute reality.**

**What this means:**

- **"Pessimistic" (Scenario 1):** Actually closer to TRUE realistic for first-time business owners with zero experience
- **"Realistic" (Scenario 2):** Actually an OPTIMISTIC base case (assumes favorable conditions, some luck)
- **"Optimistic" (Scenario 3):** Best-case scenario (everything goes right, minimal friction)

**Why the confusing labels?**  
The original plan assumed 20 friends would all participate with zero churn. Relative to THAT baseline, these scenarios seemed pessimistic/realistic/optimistic. In absolute terms, all three scenarios are more optimistic than typical first-time entrepreneur outcomes.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
- **Plan for:** Scenario 1 ("Pessimistic" = actual realistic)
- **Hope for:** Scenario 2 ("Realistic" = actual optimistic)
- **Be pleasantly surprised by:** Scenario 3 ("Optimistic" = everything breaks your way)

**Bottom line:** Even Scenario 1 (5 friends, high churn) saves Gs. 5.7M and builds 200+ hours experience. That's a WIN, not a failure. Manage expectations accordingly.

---

**Key Insight:** Even with realistic (not optimistic) assumptions, you save enough to launch professionally.

## 📉 SCENARIO 1: PESSIMISTIC (30% probability)

### **What Happens**

**Friend Response:**
- 20 friends contacted
- 5 say "yes, let's try" (25% conversion - low)
- 8 say "maybe later" (40%)
- 7 say "no thanks" (35%)

**Client Retention:**
- 5 friends try first session
- 3 quit after 1-2 sessions (60% churn - ouch)
- 2 become semi-regular (1-2 sessions/month)
- 0 referrals (friends don't rave about it)

**Pricing Reality:**
- Month 1-3: Gs. 60K (can't raise - friends say "too expensive")
- Month 4-12: Stuck at Gs. 60K (no pricing power)

**Session Volume:**
- Months 1-3: 8-10 sessions/month (struggling)
- Months 4-6: 10-12 sessions/month (slight growth)
- Months 7-12: 12-14 sessions/month (plateau)

### **Month-by-Month Breakdown**

| Month | Sessions | Avg Price | Gross Income | Expenses | Net Profit | Cumulative Savings |

| **1** | 8 | Gs. 60K | Gs. 480K | Gs. 450K | Gs. 30K | Gs. 30K |
| **2** | 10 | Gs. 60K | Gs. 600K | Gs. 90K | Gs. 510K | Gs. 540K |
| **3** | 12 | Gs. 60K | Gs. 720K | Gs. 95K | Gs. 625K | Gs. 1.165M |

| **11** | 14 | Gs. 60K | Gs. 840K | Gs. 105K | Gs. 735K | Gs. 6.6M |
| **12** | 14 | Gs. 60K | Gs. 840K | Gs. 105K | Gs. 735K | Gs. 7.335M |

**12-Month Totals:**
- **Total Income:** Gs. 8.88M
- **Total Expenses:** Gs. 1.545M
- **Net Savings:** Gs. 7.335M ⚠️

**Problem:** Gs. 7.3M is NOT enough for professional launch (need minimum Gs. 15M for Scenario 2)

---

### **What To Do If This Happens**

**Month 4 Checkpoint:** If you're tracking below 12 sessions/month:

**ACTIVATE PLAN B:**

1. **PT Assistant Job** (under licensed PT):
   - Income: Gs. 2-3M/month
   - Time: 20-30 hours/week
   - Continues massage on side (weekends)

2. **Combined Income:**
   - PT Assistant: Gs. 2.5M/month × 9 months = Gs. 22.5M
   - Massage (side): Gs. 600K/month × 9 months = Gs. 5.4M
   - **Total saved:** Gs. 27.9M ✅✅

**Result:** Even in WORST case, you hit professional launch capital with Plan B.

- 15 friends try first session
- 4-5 quit after few sessions (30% churn - low for wellness)
- 10-11 become regular clients
- 5-6 referrals by Month 6 (friends rave about results)

**Pricing Reality:**

- **Total Expenses:** Gs. 1.75M
- **Net Savings:** Gs. 22.44M ✅✅

**Outcome:** Strong professional launch with multiple options (can do Scenario 1: Solo Practice)

---

### **Why Only 20% Probability?**

**This requires EVERYTHING to go right:**
- ✅ 75% of friends say yes (requires strong relationships + great pitch)
- ✅ Only 30% churn (requires excellent service quality)
- ✅ Referrals come consistently (requires client advocacy)
- ✅ Sustain 26-28 sessions/month while studying full-time (burnout risk)
- ✅ No major disruptions (health, exams, family issues)

**Possible? Yes. Likely? No.**

Don't plan for this. If it happens, celebrate.

## 🎯 PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED EXPECTED VALUE

| Scenario | Probability | 12-Month Savings | Weighted Value |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Pessimistic** | 30% | Gs. 7.335M | Gs. 2.20M |
| **Realistic** | 50% | Gs. 16.27M | Gs. 8.135M |
| **Optimistic** | 20% | Gs. 22.44M | Gs. 4.49M |
| **EXPECTED VALUE** | **100%** | - | **Gs. 14.825M** |

**What this means:**
- **Expected savings:** Gs. 14.8M (accounting for all scenarios)
- **Enough to launch?** YES - covers Scenario 2 (Consultorio Compartido) which requires Gs. 15M
- **Margin:** Tight but doable (within Gs. 200K of target)

**Strategy:** Target Realistic scenario, prepare for Pessimistic with Plan B.

---

## 🔬 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### **What if only 3 friends say yes?**

**Worse than Pessimistic scenario:**
- Sessions: 6-10/month
- Income: Gs. 400-600K/month
- 12-month savings: Gs. 4-5M (NOT enough)

**SOLUTION: Activate Plan B by Month 3**
- PT Assistant job: Gs. 2.5M/month × 10 months = Gs. 25M
- Massage (side): Gs. 500K/month × 10 months = Gs. 5M
- **Combined:** Gs. 30M ✅✅ (MORE than massage-only optimistic case)

**Key Insight:** Plan B is better income than massage anyway. Massage builds client base for post-license.

---

### **What if client churn is 70%?**

**Impact:**
- Regular clients: 3-4 (instead of 6-10)
- Need constant new client acquisition
- Revenue unstable month-to-month

**SOLUTION:**
1. **Focus on referrals:** Incentivize existing clients (Gs. 20K discount for referral)
2. **Expand network:** Beyond initial 20 friends (gym contacts, university classmates)
3. **Improve retention:** Survey clients, improve technique, personalize approach
4. **Accept reality:** Some people just don't stick with wellness massage (not your fault)

**OR:** Activate Plan B (PT Assistant) for stable income.

---

### **What if can't raise prices above Gs. 70K?**

**Impact:**
- Monthly income capped at Gs. 1.4M (20 sessions × Gs. 70K)
- 12-month savings: ~Gs. 12M (below Scenario 2 threshold)

**SOLUTION:**
1. **Increase volume:** 24-26 sessions/month (weekend availability)
2. **Add upsells:** Gs. 30K thermal therapy add-on
3. **Packages:** "4 sessions for Gs. 260K" (Gs. 65K each, prepaid)
4. **OR Plan B:** PT Assistant job bridges gap

---

### **What if exam weeks kill availability?**

**Reality:** Months 4-5 (midterms) and 10-11 (finals) → reduced sessions

**Impact:**
- Expected: 20 sessions/month
- Reality: 12-14 sessions/month (40% drop)
- Revenue hit: Gs. 500K-800K those months

**SOLUTION BUILT INTO PROJECTIONS:**
- Realistic scenario already assumes bumpy growth (not smooth)
- Save aggressively in good months (buffer for bad months)
- Communicate early with clients ("reduced availability May 15-30")

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### **Months 1-3: Execute Pessimistic Plan**

**Mindset:** Assume worst case (only 5 friends, high churn)

**Why?**
- If reality is better → ahead of plan ✅
- If reality matches → on track ✅
- If reality is worse → already have Plan B ready ✅

**Actions:**
- Target 8-12 sessions/month
- Price Gs. 60K (no pressure)
- Focus on service quality > volume
- Track churn rate monthly

---

### **Month 4-6: Reassess & Pivot**

**If hitting Realistic targets** (16-20 sessions/month, 40% churn):
- ✅ Continue massage-only track
- ✅ Raise prices to Gs. 75-80K
- ✅ Ask for referrals

**If hitting Pessimistic targets** (10-12 sessions/month, 60% churn):
- ⚠️ Activate Plan B search (start applying to PT assistant positions)
- ⚠️ Keep massage going (weekends only)
- ⚠️ Accept this as side income, not primary

**If hitting Optimistic targets** (20+ sessions/month, <30% churn):
- 🎉 Celebrate, but don't get complacent
- 🎉 Save extra money (buffer)
- 🎉 Consider raising prices faster

---

### **Months 7-12: Optimize & Execute**

**If Optimistic track:**
- Coast, maintain quality
- Save extra for premium post-license launch

**If Realistic track:**
- Stay on target
- Hit Gs. 16M savings goal
- Launch Scenario 2 post-license

**If Pessimistic track + Plan B:**
- PT Assistant job (primary income)
- Massage (client base building)
- Still hit Gs. 25M+ savings ✅

---

## 🛡️ PLAN B DETAILS (If Massage Income <Gs. 1M/month by Month 4)

### **Track: PT Assistant Under Licensed Physiotherapist**

**What it is:**
- Work 20-30 hours/week under licensed PT
- Support patient treatments (supervised)
- Learn professional workflows
- Get paid Gs. 2-3M/month

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Stable income (not client-dependent)
- ✅ Professional experience (better than massage)
- ✅ Networking (licensed PTs can refer to you post-license)
- ✅ Resume building
- ✅ Still do massage on weekends (build client base)

**How to find:**
- LinkedIn: "Asistente de fisioterapeuta"
- Direct contact: Visit clinics, offer services
- AKYFPY network: Ask licensed PTs if they need help
- Expected search time: 2-4 weeks

---

### **Combined Income Model (Plan B)**

| Income Source | Hours/Week | Monthly Income | 9-Month Total |
|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **PT Assistant** | 25 | Gs. 2.5M | Gs. 22.5M |
| **Weekend Massage** | 8 | Gs. 600K | Gs. 5.4M |
| **TOTAL** | 33 | **Gs. 3.1M/month** | **Gs. 27.9M** |

**Outcome:** Save MORE than massage-only Optimistic scenario (Gs. 27.9M > Gs. 22.4M)

**Why massage still valuable:**
- Builds client base for post-license (those 40-60 clients are GOLD)
- Maintains massage skills
- Proves demand for your services

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOME SUMMARY

### **Most Likely Result (50% probability):**
- 10 friends try massage
- 40% churn → 6 regular clients
- 16-20 sessions/month by Month 6
- Gradual price increases (Gs. 60K → 90K)
- **12-month savings: Gs. 16.27M**
- **Can launch:** Scenario 2 (Consultorio Compartido) ✅

---

### **Worst Case with Plan B:**
- Only 3-5 friends stick with massage
- Activate PT Assistant job by Month 4
- Combined income Gs. 3M/month
- **12-month savings: Gs. 27.9M**
- **Can launch:** Scenario 1 (Solo Practice) OR Scenario 2 with buffer ✅✅

---

### **Best Case (20% probability):**

- Low churn, referrals flowing
- 24-28 sessions/month
- **12-month savings: Gs. 22.4M**
- **Can launch:** Scenario 1 with premium equipment ✅✅

---

## ✅ KEY TAKEAWAYS

### **1. Don't count on hockey-stick growth**
Even Realistic scenario has bumpy months (exams, holidays, churn)

PT Assistant job gives MORE capital + better experience than massage-only

### **3. Expected value is Gs. 14.8M**
Accounting for all scenarios, you save enough to launch professionally

### **4. Churn is normal**
40-60% first-year churn is STANDARD for wellness services (not your fault)

### **5. Focus on what you control**
- Service quality → reduces churn
- Communication → builds trust
- Consistency → drives referrals

### **6. Track numbers monthly**
By Month 3, you'll know if you're Pessimistic/Realistic/Optimistic track
