## What's In This Archive

This directory contains the original comprehensive business plan created before we discovered the client's actual situation:

- `referencias/` - Executive summaries, legal framework, business plan overview
- `02-plan-negocio/` - Marketing playbook, operational model, commercial strategy

## Current Executable Plan

**For Mikie Moyano Nakamura's actual situation, see:**

📁 **`/implementation/`** - Complete student bridge plan

This is a **TWO-TRACK strategy:**

**Track 1 (NOW - Months 1-12):** 
- Informal wellness massage practice while studying
- Legal for students (disclosed unlicensed status)
- Save Gs. 15-20M for professional launch
- Build experience and client base

**Track 2 (LATER - Month 13+):**
- Launch professional practice AFTER graduation + license
- Execute modified version of THIS archived plan
- With saved capital and experience from Track 1

---

## Why We Kept This

Although this plan is NOT executable now, it contains valuable content that WILL be useful after Mikie graduates and obtains her professional license:

✅ **Market research** - Competitive analysis still valid  
✅ **Legal framework** - Requirements for licensed PTs in Paraguay  
✅ **Financial models** - Scenarios 1-2 will be executable post-license  
✅ **Marketing playbook** - Professional marketing strategies (post-license)  
✅ **Operational model** - How to run a PT consultorio  

**Timeline:** This plan becomes relevant in **Month 10-13** (when preparing for post-license launch)
