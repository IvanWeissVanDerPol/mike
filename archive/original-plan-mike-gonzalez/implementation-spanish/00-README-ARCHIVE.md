## ⚠️ Why These Files Are Archived

These Spanish-language implementation files were created for the **original business plan** which assumed:
- ✅ Licensed physiotherapist (matrícula professional)
- ✅ Gs. 50-70M capital available
- ✅ Ready to launch professional consultorio immediately
- ✅ Professional equipment (massage table, TENS, ultrasound)

**Reality:** Mikie is a student (not yet licensed), has Gs. 0 capital, graduates in 12 months.

**Correct files to use NOW:** `/implementation/` (numbered 00-08, English)
