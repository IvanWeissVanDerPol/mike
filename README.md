## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Repository Identity Clarification

**This repository contains TWO plans:**

### **PLAN A: For Licensed Professional (ARCHIVED)**
- **Client:** "Mike González" (fictional/assumed)
- **Status:** Licensed physiotherapist with Gs. 50-70M capital
- **Location:** `archive/original-plan-mike-gonzalez/`
- **Executability:** ❌ NOT for current client

### **PLAN B: For Student (CURRENT - EXECUTABLE)**
- **Client:** Mikie Moyano Nakamura
- **Status:** Final-year student (not yet licensed)
- **Location:** `implementation/`
- **Executability:** ✅ START HERE

**Why two plans?** Original plan was created for wrong person. After discovering client's actual situation (student with zero capital), we created new executable plan. Old plan archived for reference (will be useful post-license).
